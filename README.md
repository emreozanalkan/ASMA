Autonomous Shopping Mall Assistant

The aim of this project is to understand the inner working of ROS and to gain an indepth knowledge of robot navigation, control and vision using ROS. For this purpose we have created ASMA (Automatic Shopping Mall Assistance), that would navigate in a known map and perform tasks that would be encountered in a day to day life of a shopping mall robot. This has been achieved by using the groovy distribution of ROS running on a turtlebot. The robot would perform tasks such as voice control, face recognition, visual servoing, tag detection and manual override while moving on a predefined map. All of this is achieved by using a finite state machine implementation to make it modular, easy to visualize and debug.
